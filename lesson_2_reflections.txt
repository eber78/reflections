  in te working directory. If you don´t initialize a repository you can´t star working wiht git
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?
    
  The staging area contains all the changes that will be committed. You can divide one big change into
  multiple stages. It helps you choose which changes you want to commit
